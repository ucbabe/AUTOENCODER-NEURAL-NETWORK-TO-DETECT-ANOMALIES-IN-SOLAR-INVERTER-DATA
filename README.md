# AUTOENCODER-NEURAL-NETWORK-TO-DETECT-ANOMALIES-IN-SOLAR-INVERTER-DATA
This project is the product of the summer research internship by Research Experience for Nigerian Engineering Undergraduates (RENEU). I worked under Dr Siby Platottham who is an energy research scientist at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The project focused on leveraging autoencoder neural network to detect and predict anomalies coming from a solar inverter. It also involves finetuning a threshold using different techniques that would serve as anomaly threshold in which other values aboue this value is tagged an anomaly. Founded by Prof chibueze Amanchukwu of University of Chicago and Funded by National Science Foundation (NSF), the internship taught valuable research experience to Nigeria Undergraduates with the aim of translating the knowledge gained into grad school programs in the US.
